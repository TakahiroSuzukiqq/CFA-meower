# Memo  
When I was creating this app I met the database error as following image, so I just following the [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17933522/postgres-on-rails-fatal-database-does-not-exist).  
But this is just for the reference and I don't take any of responsibility by doing the action.
